## What does the extension include?
- **Full PohLang v0.5.2 Runtime** (Rust-based, bundled)
- **20 Phrasal Expressions** (e.g., `total of`, `make uppercase`, `join...with`)
- **Syntax Highlighting** for both symbolic and phrasal syntax
- **IntelliSense** with completions and documentation
- **40+ Code Snippets** for quick coding
- **Integrated Execution** (press Ctrl+F5 to run)

## Example Code
```pohlang
Start Program

Make greeting = "Hello, World!"
Make uppercased = make uppercase(greeting)
Write(uppercased)

Make numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Make sum = total of(numbers)
Write("Sum: " plus sum)

End Program
